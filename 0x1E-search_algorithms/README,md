# Search Algorithms

This project focuses on implementing and understanding basic search algorithms in C. The primary objective is to explore how search algorithms work and practice implementing them in a structured way.

## Files in the Repository

1. **`search_algos.h`**
   - Header file containing function prototypes for the search algorithms implemented in this project.

2. **`linear_search.c`**
   - Implements the `linear_search` function, which searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear Search algorithm.

3. **`binary_search.c`**
   - Implements the `binary_search` function, which searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary Search algorithm.

## Function Details

### Linear Search

- **Prototype:**
  ```c
  int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
