Description
This project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum and focuses on implementing a hash table data structure in C. A hash table is a data structure that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data using a technique called hashing. The project covers the fundamentals of hash tables, including their creation, collision handling using chaining, and hash functions.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Understand the purpose and functionality of hash tables.
Implement a hash table in C using linked lists to handle collisions.
Manage memory allocation and deallocation when working with dynamic data structures.
Apply the principles of hashing to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.
