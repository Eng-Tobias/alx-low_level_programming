# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. In this project, we focus on more advanced concepts involving pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.

## Tasks

### 0. strcat
- **File:** `0-strcat.c`
- **Prototype:** `char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);`
- This function concatenates two strings by appending the `src` string to the `dest` string, overwriting the terminating null byte at the end of `dest`, and then adds a terminating null byte.
